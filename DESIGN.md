# FinanceQA AI Agent - Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design philosophy, architectural decisions, and implementation trade-offs for the FinanceQA AI Agent. The agent was specifically designed to improve upon the 54.1% baseline score of non-agentic approaches through strategic tool orchestration, iterative reasoning, and specialized financial analysis capabilities.

## Overall Design Approach

### Design Philosophy

The agent follows a **"Decompose, Search, Synthesize"** philosophy:

1. **Decompose**: Break down complex financial questions into constituent formulas and required data points
2. **Search**: Systematically gather information from multiple authoritative sources
3. **Synthesize**: Combine retrieved information to calculate accurate answers with transparent reasoning

### Architecture Pattern: Enhanced ReAct with Custom Control Flow

    M --> N{Max Iterations or Complete?}
    N -->|Continue| L
    N -->|Complete| K
    K --> O[Final Answer with Explanation]
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Structured Reasoning**: Unlike pure LLM inference, this approach enforces systematic analysis
- **Iterative Refinement**: Allows the agent to gather missing information progressively
- **Tool Specialization**: Each tool optimized for specific types of financial information
- **Transparent Process**: Every step is traceable and explainable

### Core Components

#### 1. FinanceQAAgent Class (`main.py`)
**Design Decision**: Centralized agent orchestration with modular tool integration
- **Trade-off**: Single agent vs. multi-agent system
- **Rationale**: Simplifies coordination while maintaining tool specialization
- **Implementation**: LangChain ReAct pattern with custom tool definitions

#### 2. Custom Control Flow (`control.py`)
**Design Decision**: Domain-specific control logic separate from generic ReAct
- **Trade-off**: Flexibility vs. optimization for financial tasks
- **Rationale**: Financial questions have predictable patterns that benefit from specialized handling
- **Implementation**: Dual pathway processing based on context availability

#### 3. Tool Ecosystem (9 Specialized Tools)
**Design Decision**: Comprehensive tool suite vs. minimalist approach
- **Trade-off**: Complexity vs. coverage
- **Rationale**: Financial analysis requires diverse information sources; better to have unused tools than missing capabilities

## Key Trade-offs and Decisions

### 1. Language Model Selection

**Decision**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
**Alternatives Considered**: 
- GPT-4 (higher cost, potentially better accuracy)
- Open-source models (Llama, Mistral)
- Specialized financial models

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Reliable, fast, cost-effective, strong reasoning
- ❌ **Cons**: External dependency, API costs, no fine-tuning control

**Rationale**: Balanced performance/cost for prototype development with upgrade path to GPT-4

### 2. Tool Architecture: Breadth vs. Depth

**Decision**: 9 specialized tools covering diverse information sources

| Tool Category | Tools | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **Analysis** | `formula_analysis_tool`, `key_terms_search_tool` | Essential for question understanding |
| **Data Sources** | `finnhub_search_tool`, `web_search_tool`, `rag_search_tool` | Multiple authoritative sources |
| **Computation** | `financial_calculator_tool` | Safe, auditable calculations |
| **Knowledge** | `knowledge_base_tool`, `direct_rag_search_tool` | Background information and fast lookups |
| **Web Access** | `fetch_webpage_content_tool` | Access to real-time information |

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Breadth**: Handles diverse question types and scenarios
- ❌ **Complexity**: More integration points, potential for tool confusion
- ✅ **Redundancy**: Multiple paths to information increase success rate
- ❌ **Performance**: More tools mean longer execution times

### 3. Control Flow: Custom vs. Pure ReAct

**Decision**: Hybrid approach with custom control flow for financial scenarios

**Pure ReAct Limitations for Financial Tasks**:
- Generic reasoning not optimized for financial formula identification
- No systematic approach to data extraction from financial documents
- Lacks structured assessment of information completeness

**Custom Control Flow Benefits**:
- **Path 1 (WITH CONTEXT)**: Optimized for document analysis
- **Path 2 (NO CONTEXT)**: Handles conceptual/calculation questions
- **Iterative Tool Selection**: Systematic information gathering
- **Assessment Loop**: Prevents infinite tool usage

**Implementation Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Performance**: Faster convergence on correct answers
- ❌ **Flexibility**: Less adaptable to novel question types
- ✅ **Predictability**: Consistent reasoning patterns
- ❌ **Maintenance**: More complex codebase

### 4. Information Completeness Assessment

**Decision**: LLM-based assessment with structured prompts

```python
def assess_information_completeness(question_data, formula, extraction_result, agent):
    assessment_prompt = f"""
    ORIGINAL QUESTION: {question_data['question']}
    FORMULA IDENTIFIED: {formula}
    VALUES EXTRACTED: {extraction_result['values']}
    
    Respond in this exact format:
    COMPLETE_ANSWER: Yes/No
    MISSING_INFO: List any missing information or "None"
    CONFIDENCE: High/Medium/Low
    """
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Adaptability**: Handles diverse formula types
- ❌ **Reliability**: Depends on LLM consistency
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to modify assessment criteria
- ❌ **Cost**: Additional LLM calls for each assessment

### 5. Safety and Error Handling

**Decision**: Multiple layers of safety with graceful degradation

**Financial Calculator Safety**:
```python
def financial_calculator_tool(expression: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Use numexpr for safe evaluation
        result = numexpr.evaluate(expression)
        return f"Calculation result: {expression} = {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Calculation error: {str(e)}"
```

**API Call Safety**:
- Timeout handling (10 seconds for external APIs)
- Graceful degradation when optional tools fail
- Caching for expensive operations (embeddings)

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Reliability**: Prevents crashes and security issues
- ❌ **Performance**: Additional overhead for safety checks
- ✅ **User Experience**: Helpful error messages
- ❌ **Development Time**: More code complexity

### 6. Data Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Selective caching for expensive operations

**Cached Operations**:
- Embedding computations (`test_rag_financeqa.py`)
- Dataset loading
- Working answers for session continuity

**Not Cached**:
- Real-time financial data (intentionally fresh)
- Web search results (time-sensitive)
- API responses (to respect rate limits)

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Performance**: Faster repeated operations
- ❌ **Storage**: Disk space for cache files
- ✅ **Cost**: Reduced API calls
- ❌ **Freshness**: Risk of stale data

## Evaluation Strategy

### Benchmark Performance Assessment

**Evaluation Approach**:
1. **Question Type Analysis**: Performance across basic, assumption, and conceptual questions
2. **Tool Utilization Metrics**: Success rate per tool and combination effectiveness
3. **Reasoning Quality**: Accuracy of intermediate steps, not just final answers
4. **Error Analysis**: Systematic categorization of failure modes

**Key Metrics**:
- **Overall Accuracy**: Percentage of correct final answers
- **Partial Credit**: Credit for correct reasoning with minor calculation errors
- **Tool Efficiency**: Average number of tools used per question
- **Confidence Calibration**: Correlation between confidence scores and accuracy

**Expected Improvements Over 54.1% Baseline**:

| Question Type | Baseline | Expected | Improvement Strategy |

    """
    Clear description for LLM understanding
    Use for: Specific use cases
    Input: Expected input format
    """
    try:
        # Implementation with proper error handling
        return formatted_result
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Tool error: {str(e)}"
```

**Benefits**:

```python
def formula_analysis_tool(question: str) -> str:
    analysis_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this financial question and extract:
    1. The formula needed for calculation
    2. Key terms that need to be found
    3. Synonyms for those key terms
    
    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
    - For EBITDA questions: Include "Net Income", "Interest", "Taxes", "Depreciation", "Amortization"
    - For Adjusted metrics: Use base metric + adjustments
